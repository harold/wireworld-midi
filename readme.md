Just the beginnings of some ideas about how to trigger midi from a wireworld simulation.

It's literally the first thing I tried, and so is likely not great.

The .NET midi library I'm using (http://code.google.com/p/midi-dot-net/) seems decent for Windows.

I'm also using LoopBe1 (http://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html) as the internal midi device.
